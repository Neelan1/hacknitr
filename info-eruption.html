                <li>Seek shelter indoors.</li>
                <li>If caught in a rockfall, roll into a ball to protect your head.</li>
                <li> If near a stream or river, be aware of rising water and possible mudflows in low-lying areas. Move up-slope as quickly as possible.</li>
                <li>Seek care for burns right away. Immediate care can be life saving.</li>
                <li>If your eyes, nose, and throat become irritated from volcanic gases and fumes, move away from the area immediately. Your symptoms should go away when you are no longer in contact with the gases or fumes. If the symptoms continue, consult your doctor.</li>
