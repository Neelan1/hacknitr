      <li>Listen to a portable radio for critical storm updates, information, and instructions.</li>
      <li>Avoid all windows, skylights, and glass doors and remain inside.Go to a secure location, such as a closet, internal room, or basement restroom.</li>
      <li>ever leave the safety of your house or other shelter before it is certain that the storm has moved on.
        While severe winds are still coming, the storm's eye may produce a brief and misleading respite. </li>
      <li> Maintain the refrigerator closed if the power goes out to keep cold air inside and prevent perishable food from spoiling. 
        If you utilise a portable generator, abide by all directions provided by the maker.
        In order to avoid electrical shock, generators should be properly grounded. They should also never be used indoors, in basements, garages, or areas where windows, doors, or vents are nearby.
        Considering that generators emit carbon monoxide (CO), confirm that your home is equipped with a functional CO detector. </li>
