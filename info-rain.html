      <li>Avoid small creeks and rivers, as they can fill up quickly and their banks can erode</li>
      <li>Checking structures around your house for weak spots, clearing debris from gutters, fastening items that could become deadly projectiles, cutting away dead trees and branches and ensuring adequate drainage, is essential and will significantly reduce your risk. Reinforcing vital structures if you live in a rain, flood or wind prone area is also a good idea.Â </li>
      <li>Always keep an eye on the weather forecast and look out for warnings of heavy rains and high winds. Avoid danger areas where possible.</li>
      <li>Never drive through flood water, as the average car can be swept off the road in 12 inches of moving water</li>
      <li>If you are told to evacuate by emergency personnel, do so immediately</li>
